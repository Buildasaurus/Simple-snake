Simple-Snake

This is a very simple version of snake, on which another version of snake has been built. There is no timer, so you choose when the next frame happens by pressing the arrow keys, or WASD.

## Running the program
The expected way to run the program is by opening the jar through command line with two inputs *n* and *m* that control column- and rowcount respectively.
The command you can use to run the program is java -jar <NameOfJarFile> <columncount> <rowcount>
If not running it in this way it will default to a 30x30 board but is still perfectly functional.

The program expects you use azul-zulu. Here is where you can find it.

If you still have errors after having downloaded azul here, make sure that you actually running it with the right java. You may have other versions installed that doesn't work.
